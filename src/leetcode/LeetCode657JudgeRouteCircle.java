/**
 * Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.
 * <p>
 * The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "UD"
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "LL"
 * Output: false
